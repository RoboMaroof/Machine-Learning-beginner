# Basic Machine Learning Methods in Python

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that were intended to familiarize myself and interested readers with the basic machine learning methods. 
They demonstrate fundamental techniques in machine learning, focusing on regression and classification problems. 
The datasets were sourced from Kaggle.

## Regression

### Battery Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction

- **File:** [Battery_RUL_Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb](Battery_RUL_Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
- **Description:** This notebook demonstrates simple regression models to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries. It provides a basic understanding of regression analysis.
- **Dataset:** The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and involves battery lifecycle data.
- **Machine Learning Methods:** 
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Scatter plots, Correlation Matrix, Box Plots
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Outlier filtering, Feature scaling, Dataset split
  - **Regressors:** Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, KNN, Ridge Regression


### Classification

### Customer Segmentation

- **File:** [Customer_Segmentation.ipynb](Customer_Segmentation.ipynb)
- **Description:** This notebook focuses on classifying customers into different segments. It showcases the application of regression models in classification problems.
- **Dataset:** The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and includes various attributes for customer segmentation.
- **Machine Learning Methods:**
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Count plots, Pair plots, Distribution plots
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, Standardization, One Hot Encoding, Combined pipelines
  - **Classifier:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBClassifier
